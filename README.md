# QR Bus Ticket Booking System

In Sri Lanka, the traditional bus ticketing process relies on conductors issuing tickets manually during 
the journey. While functional, this method can result in inefficiencies, delays, and challenges in 
managing cash transactions, particularly during peak hours. To address these issues, we present the Bus 
Booking and QR Verification System an innovative solution to revolutionize the ticketing and boarding 
process for public transportation.   
 
This system offers passengers the convenience of pre-booking their seats online and receiving a unique 
QR code as a digital ticket. Upon boarding the bus, passengers can simply scan their QR code at a 
designated scanner to validate their tickets, eliminating the need for manual ticket checks and 
improving the overall travel experience.  








### _Streamlined Boarding Process_:

The QR-based verification system speeds up the boarding process by automating ticket validation. 
Passengers tap their QR tickets on a scanner, ensuring a quick and hassle-free entry.  


### _Enhanced Convenience_:

Passengers can book seats through a mobile app or website, receive their QR tickets instantly, and 
avoid the inconvenience of carrying cash or waiting for conductors during the journey. 

### _Increased Accuracy and Accountability_: 

The system records passenger data and travel details digitally, reducing errors and enhancing 
accountability for both passengers and operators.   

### _Eco-Friendly Alternative_: 

By transitioning to digital tickets, the system eliminates the need for paper tickets, supporting 
sustainable and environmentally conscious practices.
